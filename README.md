# Well, if everyone else is doing it...

This is a Wordle solver. It's fast enough (after its initial guess, which I might just hardcode). Guesses should be 5 letters long, corresponding to the colors you get from Wordle:

- Green = `g` (exact match)
- Yellow = `y` (letter appears, but is in the wrong spot)
- Black = `x` (letter does not appear)
